# Data files for WebbPSF

Each instrument has its own directory, which in turn have subdirectories as follows:

  * OPD - optical path difference maps derived from the as-built OTE optical model Revision G (for the static surface figures of each segments) and the overall JWST optical error budget Revision W (for OTE to ISIM misalignments, WFSC residuals, stability, and budgeted uncertainties for both the OTE and SI contributions). For full details, see http://pythonhosted.org/webbpsf/jwst.html.
  * filters - Filter transmission files for public distribution. 
  * optics - Pupil and image masks (e.g. for coronagraphs)
